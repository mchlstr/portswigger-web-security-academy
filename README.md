# Portswigger web security academy

The [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) is a free online training center for web application security.

I will periodically upload the study notes for the next six months as I review the materials covered in the course. I will also provide links to helpful online resources to guide me and anybody reading my notes to pass the exam and become a [Burp Suite Certified Practitioner] (https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification).
