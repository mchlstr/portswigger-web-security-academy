# Lab: Low-level logic flaw

## Lab Description

This lab doesn't **adequately validate user input**. You can exploit a logic flaw in its **purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price**. To solve the lab, buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket".

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

## Lab Solution

**Lessons Learned**: Integer overflow is tricky to notice, but it can have disastrous results on special occasions.

**What is integer overflow?**

In programming languages, integers are typically allocated a specific number of bits in memory to store numeric values. For instance, a 32-bit integer data type reserves space to hold an unsigned integer ranging between 0 and 4,294,967,295 or a signed integer within the range of âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

Because integers are signed by default, an integer overflow can lead to unexpected consequences when a value exceeds the maximum limit. This overflow might cause a change in the signedness of the integer, resulting in intriguing effects on the following code execution.
