# Lab Description

This lab stores user **chat logs** directly on the server's file system, and retrieves them using static URLs.

Solve the lab by finding the `password` for the user `carlos`, and logging into their account.

# Lab Solution

2. Send a message and then select View transcript or just select View transcript. Capture the request.
